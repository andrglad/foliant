    <p>To start the work with the metrics on the <strong>Scan results</strong> page, it’s necessary to select the time interval using the <strong>Periods</strong> drop-down menu on the <strong>Filters</strong> tab at the top right. It’s possible to select an interval from the last week to the last three years. The following metrics are shown for the selected period.</p>
    <ul class="Disc">
      <li>New issues grouped by practice (counted by four practices: SAST, DAST, SCA Security, and SCA Compliance), if the <strong>Practice</strong> item is chosen on the <strong>Group by</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>New issues grouped by severity (counted by the severity levels: Low severity, Medium severity, High severity, and Critical severity) if the <strong>Severity</strong> item is chosen on the <strong>Group by</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>Scan history, measured by the number of Successful and Failed scans.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><img height="888" src="assets/images/image429.png" width="95%" /></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>It is possible to to tune the charts. To get the new issues for one or more practices, select <strong>Practice</strong> item in the <strong>Group by</strong> window and click the practice name (SAST, DAST, SCA Security, SCA Compliance) on the chart to include/exclude the issues found by this practice. Thus, it’s possible to leave, for example, just one practice on this chart. Here is an example of the SCA Security’s new issues for the last two years.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><img height="890" src="assets/images/image430.png" width="95%" /></p>
    <p style="text-align: center"> </p>
    <p>To get the new issues metrics by severity, select the <strong>Severity</strong> item in the <strong>Group by</strong> tab and click the severity level (Low severity, Medium severity, High severity, Critical severity) to include or exclude issues of this severity from the chart. Thus, it’s possible to leave just issues of medium severity on this chart, for example. Here is an example of the medium severity new issues chart for the last two years.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><img height="888" src="assets/images/image431.png" width="95%" /></p>

Click the Successful or Failed item to include or exclude corresponding scans from the chart. Click the <strong>Broken</strong>, <strong>QG skipped</strong>, <strong>QG failed</strong>, <strong>QG Passed</strong> chart item to include or exclude the corresponding scans from the chart.</p>
