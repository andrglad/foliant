      <h3 data-list-level="4">Sync of Security Defect with Defect Tracking System</h3>
      <p>Let’s assume that one or several defects were created or updated in Maverix. All newly created or updated in Maverix security defects should be synchronized with a defect tracking system (e.g., Jira).</p>
      <p>For correct synchronization of defects between Maverix and Jira, these two tools shall be in sync. For more information, see the &quot;<a data-xref="{title}" href="Sync_with_Jira.htm">Sync with Jira</a>&quot; section.</p>
      <p>Select the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item at the top left. Click the <strong>Show app details</strong> <img alt="image278.png" class="ns" src="assets/images/image257.png"/> button at the bottom right of the application card and open the Application page.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"><img height="762" src="assets/images/image424.png" width="95%"/></p>
      <p style="text-align: center"> </p>
      <p>Select the <strong>Defects</strong> menu item on the left. The application defects page appears. Click the <strong>Show filters</strong> <img alt="image281.png" class="ns" height="19.6" src="assets/images/image259.png" width="34"/> button at the top right. On the <strong>Filters</strong> tab, select <strong>Registered</strong> or <strong>Open</strong> in the <strong>by status</strong> field. The page will display security defects that are ready to be synchronized. Click the <strong>Sync with tracker</strong> <img alt="image274.png" class="ns" height="17" src="assets/images/image260.png" width="30"/> button at the top right. After a short sync, the confirmation message appears at the bottom right of the screen. Defects have been synchronized between Maverix and Jira.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p style="text-align: center"><img height="944" src="assets/images/image425.png" width="95%"/></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After successful synchronization, each defect has a link to Jira. It is shown in the <strong>External</strong> column. Click the link and log in to your Jira account to continue working on this defect.</p>
