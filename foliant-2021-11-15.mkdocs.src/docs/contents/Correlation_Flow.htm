  <p>The <strong>Correlation Flow</strong> page provides analytics on the correlation of issues found during the security testing of the application by the AST tools and resulting in the application security defects based on them.</p>

  <p>This tab provides statistics on the work of a Security Engineer in terms of analyzing the correlation of security issues and creation of security defects based on them. Security issues found by the AST tools are counted by four practices (SCA Compliance, SCA Security, SAST, and DAST). The next separation of issues is performed by issue status (Technical debt, False Positive, Confirmed, Fixed). Maverix helps you define correlation of security issues, group issues and submit security defects.</p>
  <p>The security defects opened based on the security issues can be filtered by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and by application.</p>
  <p>To get the Correlation Flow metric for a particular application, click the <strong>Applications</strong> field on the <strong>Filters</strong> tab at the top right and select the application from the drop-down menu.</p>
  <p>Use the drop-down menu in the <strong>Severity</strong> field on the <strong>Filters</strong> tab to get the Correlation Flow metric for security defects with a particular severity level.</p>
  <p>Click the <img alt="image192.png" class="ns" src="assets/images/image282.png" /> button at the top right to reset the filters.</p>
